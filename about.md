I was born in Mysooru, India to broad-minded, loving parents.

I earn my living as a consultant specializing in Embedded Systems at [Ã…F](http://www.afconsult.com/).

My most recent work as an academic was that of a [post-doc at NTNU Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/ananya.muddukrishna) analyzing performance and power problems of low-power embedded vision systems.

Here is how I look on a good-hair day:
