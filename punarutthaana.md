# [](#header-3)My Home Lab

I recently built a small Electronics lab at home for self-study and revision.
My lab is called `Punarutthaana` (ಪುನರುತ್ಥಾನ, the Kannada word for resurrection) because it resurrects a childhood hobby of Electronics prototyping.

Punarutthaana is a compact and cost-effective lab built to fit my modestly-sized home and budget.
The lab workbench is a modern secretary desk from IKEA.
With compact size as the global constraint, I balanced between expensive-but-long-lasting, cheap-and-effective, DIY, and multi-purpose tools and components for the lab.
A comprehensive list of things in the lab is available on request.

I have embarked on an epic journey of in-depth revision and fun-filled prototyping inside my lab. Here are the first steps I am taking:

*   Complete the [Real Analog](https://learn.digilentinc.com/classroom/realanalog/) design course from Digilent
*   Build atleast one hundred self-designed or kit-based analog and DSP circuits
*   Try out and modify atleast one hundred designs available on [OpenCores](https://www.opencores.org) using FPGAs and simulators
*   Practice A/V processing and neural network accelerator design on FPGAs using Xilinx [Pynq](http://www.pynq.io/) and similar devices
*   Complete embedded development and Linux driver programming courses from [Free Electrons](http://free-electrons.com/training/) using the [BeagleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/black)
*   Get hands dirty with sensor prototyping and DSP with Arduino, Teensy, and ESP32 microcontrollers
*   Tinker with radio using RTL-SDR kits


Its play time! Adios amigos!
