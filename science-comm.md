# [](#header-3)Scientific and Technical Communication Samples

*   A [RFC-like design description](https://design.ros2.org/articles/unique_network_flows.html) about 5G network integration API for the widely-used open-source [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) robotics software framework. The design description was accompanied by [working source code](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/pull/1496) that eventually got merged into mainline ROS after detailed discussions with the ROS Middleware Working Group.

*   A [paper](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nfw16hfqonzigzdg40dwg/grain-graphs-preprint-ppopp16.pdf?rlkey=1uggj55k6g5febohwlsh50vhb&st=8w4t0562&dl=0) published in PPOPP 2016, a top-tier computing conference. The paper introduced a new technique called *Grain Graphs* that visualizes performance problems of OpenMP programs in high detail.

*   The [wiki](https://github.com/anamud/grain-graphs/wiki) of the prototype implementation of Grain Graphs.

*   The [Introduction chapter](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ss34k0lk8np8n9jhqd6gn/phd-diss-upto-p40.pdf?rlkey=don5hv13i5z1xniz2vcjjio2x&st=c9vwza0o&dl=0) of my PhD dissertation. The chapter is written to provide a concise yet thorough understanding of contributions in addition to a good introduction to the subject area and problems tackled.

*   The [user guide](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c31olpbgmgffcyvh27w8g/MIR_UG.pdf?rlkey=o9axmpyu0d9k68z07z76gwzvs&st=ijdvvhm9&dl=0) of the MIR runtime system library. MIR features the rare combination of high performance execution and detailed profiling for task-based OpenMP programs. The MIR developers repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/anamud/mir-dev).

*   A [presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/31gvyz0vhgfwzbh8l1x1y/aggregated-grain-graphs.pdf?rlkey=h0542noopu2uirudlj4v0lasq&st=w4vgatd0&dl=0) about on-going work I gave recently at a [workshop](https://www.ntnu.edu/mcc2016) for Scandinavian computer architects. I have mainly used figures supplemented by speech to convey core ideas about the work.

*   A [poster](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tk8yw2moez1jk5qomn9lx/poster.pdf?rlkey=drfabss2gl1ghg62iau4l6gam&st=evohnmhm&dl=0) I made for a [popular science poster competition](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t0ondr8ghvbhfj5xqv5qa/poster-competition.pdf?rlkey=gro2umz9jbyryyqu16utdnz7n&st=9e4qwrj2&dl=0) hosted by KTH School of ICT. The poster introduced my PhD work to laymen and was accompanied by a [design description](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kcbkoe178zzeonkalg40x/poster-design.pdf?rlkey=0dfpecnwopk6gv529s6f6668v&st=8v96sn83&dl=0).

*   A [rebuttal](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/es494dobgbpimllfag5ma/ppopp-2016-rebuttal.pdf?rlkey=ivtur01xrse7o7p4s8pqjr4tj&st=li68e0r3&dl=0) to a computing conference article review. A rebuttal is a carefully composed, short argument that dispels reviewer misunderstanding, addresses reviewer concerns, and motivates why the article should be accepted for publication.

*   A [technical writing assignment](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/slmzzwa07357g4bgyxlig/spotify-assignment-report-AM.pdf?rlkey=ms50rkqxu808xgrrxjzq9e0lg&st=oc8etzjt&dl=0) for Spotify regarding their new Web API console.

*   A [reply](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0tgpy9o784yoloh4maz7r/screenshot_quora_2016-12-11_19-33-35.png?rlkey=j7o1fmymazmhkiq6mtof5bo0j&st=zv2dkwvy&dl=0) to a question on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/). I have written over 100 answers on Quora regarding Parallel Computing, Computer Architecture, and life as a researcher.
