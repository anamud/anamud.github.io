Here are selected samples of scientific and technical communication that I have produced.

- A [paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBal91YnZ0X3dERVk) published in PPOPP 2016, a top-tier computing conference. The paper introduced a new technique for visualizing performance problems of OpenMP programs in high detail.

- The [Introduction chapter](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBVmJXQkY2dmdaMFU) of my PhD dissertation. The chapter is written to provide a concise yet thorough understanding of contributions in addition to a good introduction to the subject area and problems tackled.
- The [user guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBbXliR3ZMRnY5Rlk) of the MIR runtime system library. MIR features the rare combination of high performance execution and detailed profiling for task-based OpenMP programs. The MIR developers repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/anamud/mir-dev).

- A [presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBTlpteFlsUnNPTk0) about on-going work I gave recently at a [workshop](https://www.ntnu.edu/mcc2016) for Scandinavian computer architects. I have mainly used figures supplemented by speech to convey core ideas about the work.

- A [poster](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBQkFZMkpDYU5jdDQ) I made for a [popular science poster competition](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBSHRyNm9aWjR1dmc) hosted by KTH School of ICT. The poster introduced my PhD work to laymen and was accompanied by a [design description](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBaFgzNUZ1WmpVU2c).

- A [rebuttal](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBNEU1THRZZnhXOUU) to a computing conference article review. A rebuttal is a carefully composed, short argument that dispels reviewer misunderstanding, addresses reviewer concerns, and motivates why the article should be accepted for publication.

- A [technical writing assignment](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBaXozVk5DTUNzZnc) for Spotify regarding their new Web API console.

- A [reply](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-8O7BZcJRKBWE42N0E2QXFHS3c) to a question on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/). I have written over 100 answers on Quora regarding Parallel Computing, Computer Architecture, and life as a researcher.
